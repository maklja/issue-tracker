To setup init data for application open a command line and run following commands:

```
mongo.exe ~project root~/scripts/loadData.js
```

Make sure that mongo.exe is present in environment variables on system.
Script will add three user to the database:

-   admin1@test.com - test1234 // password
-   user1@test.com - test1234 // password
-   user2@test.com - test1234 // password

To start application in development navigate to root of the project and run commands:

```
npm install
npm run start
